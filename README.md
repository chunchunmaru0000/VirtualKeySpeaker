A tool to use synthesized speech instead of microphone anywhere where 
input device can be specified.<br>

Uses external VB-AUDIO driver to output sound to,
can be downloaded here https://vb-audio.com/Cable/.<br>

After downloading driver and launching app need to select 'Speaker device'
that is a device from which sound can be heard and 
'Microphone' that is most likely to be 'CABLE Input' if you use VB-AUDIO driver.<br>
If you want to speak synthesized speech to some app then need to specify input device
in that app the same as 'Microphone' in this.

Speech synthesizer spoken language can be specified as well as some other controls.<br>
'Speak key' is a key after pressing which inputed text will be spoken.<br>
